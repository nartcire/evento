## Motivation

This is the first ever NextJS project that I've created, and I was really excited to explore the various features and tools that NextJS provides. Within this project, I've learned about the client vs server side rendering as well as how to properly structure the files for NextJS. Using NextJS will allow me to more easily create web apps that require multiple pages and easily integrate caching as well improved performance for a better user experience. Additionally, the site is hosted on Vercel and uses Postgress as the databse. This is also my first time using Vercel! Used tailwindcss as well as it is required to use NextJS.
